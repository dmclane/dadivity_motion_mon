# dadivity_motion_mon

Raspberry Pi based motion sensor which sends an email summary of detected motion.

Description of need: I wanted a way to monitor my elderly father, who lives alone and is in good health.  The available methods to do that seemed fairly instrusive which I knew he wouldn't like.  The monitor tracks how many times an hour that the motion sensor is activated, and sends me a daily summary of the activity.  Since he is on a regular schedule, the emails are very similar each day.  If I receive an email with little or no activity, I will know that something is wrong.  Note that the monitor will not notify me immediately if something is wrong and it wasn't intended to do that.  There is a button that will send me an email immediately, which is useful for confirming that the monitor is working.
